   <p> A little bit about me is that I’m a junior majoring in VDC with a minor in Business. Outside of school you can find me practicing yoga daily, hiking, snowboarding, walking with my dog or hanging out with my boyfriend. I recently completed my certification to become a hot yoga instructor and now I’m lucky enough to be able teach BeYoutiful hot yoga in Spokane. On the side of all of that I also teach dance twice a week to kids between the ages of 7-17.
